# Video conferencing Server

## How it works

Three parts

### Video chat

Simple server at the backend. Accepts socket connections and distributes them into rooms. Receives images and sends to all people in the group.

### Object detection

Computer vision model running on the device. Takes images and sends singal to body control systems to move the device accordingly.

### Robo

To be added later.
